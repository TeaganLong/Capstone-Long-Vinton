This Object Detection program utilizes a deep neural network that was trained with a large amount of annoted images. A deep neural network is a neural network with some level of complexity, usually consisting of at least two or more layers. DNNs process data by employing sophisticated mathmatical modeling. 

The model used in this project is a pre-trained model called **MobileNetv2** due to time constraints, however we have included some of the images that we modeled ourselves. A model consists of a large variety of images (dataset) with labels (or annotations) that are used by the neural network to train the model so it can be used to query data. We can define these labels in order to allow our model to detect specific objects, in the case of this project, Humans. By adding the "person" label to the pre-drawn outline boxes in the annotation process, it allows the model to reference that image along with many other similar images to perform predictions on a given input image or frame.
